        <p class="bodmas-head">What is BODMAS?</p>
        <p>
          BODMAS is an acronym for Brackets, Orders, Division, Multiplication,
          Addition Subtraction.

        <p class="bodmas-head">Of what use is BODMAS?</p>
        <p>
          In a mathematical statement or expression involving different
          operators such as Brackets, Division, Multiplication, Addition,
          Subtraction, 5+(4-3)-6*4/2+5<sup>2</sup> for instance, BODMAS enables
          you to remenber which of the operators should be evaluated first. So
          with BODMAS you can easily recall the order in which to solve
          mathematical problems.

          In what order is mathematical problems involving different operators
          solved?
        </p>
        <p>
          Brackets: calculations inside the bracket are done first.
          <br />
          e.g 5+ <span class="redd">(4-3)</span> -6*4/2+5<sup>2</sup> should
          simplify to 5+<span class="redd">1</span>-6*4/2+5<sup>2</sup><br />
          Orders: numbers involving powers or square roots or indices or
          exponents are evaluated next.<br />
          5+1-6*4/2+<span class="redd">5<sup>2</sup> </span>simplifies to
          5+1-6*4/2+<span class="redd">25</span><br />
          Division or Multiplication: you can do division before Multiplication
          or Multiplication before division, the order in which these two are
          done does not matter. I normally do division first. It is first on the
          BODMAS acronym also.<br />
          5+1-6*<span class="redd">4/2</span>+25 simplifies to 5+1-6*<span
            class="redd"
            >2</span
          >+25<br />
          And 5+1-<span class="redd">6*2</span>+25 simplifies to 5+1-<span
            class="redd"
            >12</span
          >+25<br />
          Addition or Subtraction: after brackets have been cleared, numbers
          involving powers evaluated, multiplication or division done, the next
          operation is addition or subtraction. As with mutltiplication and
          division , addition and subtraction can be done in any order. I
          usually do addition first.<br />
          <span class="redd">5</span> <span class="redd">+1</span>-12<span
            class="redd"
            >+25
          </span>
          simplifies to <span class="redd">31</span>-12 . Note that any number
          not preceeded by a sign such as 5 in this calculation is most likely a
          positive number.<br />
          And 31<span class="redd">-12 </span> finally simplifies to
          <span class="redd"> 19</span>

        <p class="bodmas-head">Are there other acronyms similar to BODMAS?</p>
        <p>
          Yes! PEMDAS and BIDMAS for instance. They all work like BODMAS<br />
          PEMDAS stands for: Parentheses-same as brackets, Exponents-same as
          orders, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction.<br />
          In BIDMAS I stands for indices, which is similar to orders.
